This project is an interactive simulator for the Selective Repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) protocol, a fundamental algorithm in computer networking for reliable data transfer. The simulator provides a visual, hands-on demonstration of how this complex protocol operates over an unreliable network. It visualizes the sender and receiver's sliding windows, the transmission of data packets, and the return of individual acknowledgments (ACKs). The key feature demonstrated is the protocol's efficiency: users can simulate network errors, such as lost packets or ACKs, and observe how the sender only retransmits the specific timed-out packet, while the receiver intelligently buffers and reassembles out-of-order packets. This tool is designed to make the concepts of packet sequencing, timers, and selective re-transmission clear and easy to understand.
